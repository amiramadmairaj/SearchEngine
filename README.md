Knockoff Google UCI Edition
This is the Knoff Google UCI Edition, and we are delighted that you chose to run our program today. Have you ever wondered how many URLS within UCI exist if you just provide one simple query word? Well, you are about to find out with this program. There are two major components to this program, the indexer and the searcher. Our biggest priority of this program is to perform a close to instantaneous search where the user is able to see the results in less than 300ms.
